==========

> This repo contains code that got started like so:

1. Interesting code that I encountered (in various blogs/websites)
2. Some problems that got asked at Interviews (I think most of the  interviewers' details have been removed)
3. Code that I would like to ask my candidates.

I tried to convert most of them into a valid-junit test that asserts (mostly assertj).
Some tests may look excessive, but they help me with debugging.

Most of the code, I indicated the source of the code/algorithm/inspiration.

`Parent-pom`, from a sibling repo, pulls down versions that have vulnerabilities. Use caution

_NOTE_

Uses [lombok](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide) to help generate some bioler plate code.
