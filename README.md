# Discussion
> This repo contains code that got started like so:

1. Most of these are test(s)
2. Interesting code that I encountered (in various blogs/websites)
3. Some problems that got asked at Interviews (I think most of the  interviewers' details have been removed)
4. Code that I would like to ask my candidates.

I tried to convert most of them into a valid-junit test that asserts something. There may be some violators remaining.

_*Transparency*_
Most of the code, I indicated the source of the code/algorithm/inspiration. Please excuse violators of this rule.
